# This is my copycat website!

I did my copycat website about DeltaMath because I wanted to challenge myself a little rather than doing something that's on a easier level like Google.
There was many issues to begin with since I started coding. One of the main issues was getting started since I wasn't sure about where to start.
When I finally got to start the coding process, I've encountered many errors such as not able to put the DeltaMath Logo right next to the listed portion of the heading. 
When I solved the issue, I was actually glad because it was the issue with the HTML rather than the CSS. I've also learned a bunch of stuff such as :float, position, and footer.
It was actually fun to see progress in my learning because in the beginning I was really confused.

This is my [Google Docs Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ihgD2KaDMT9vtjhsNKVX6e97j5Brbf8_c94ztMqyWio/edit) about my progress:
